                | My name is Vladimir Ushakov. I live in the beautiful place called Saint Petersburg, Russia. I came here in 2014 and since then I find joy living and working here. What's my job? Its a tricky question for me right now because after so many roles I played for a while, from a lawyer to a tour guide, I came with the idea that I want to focus on something that would give me not just a knowledge and a sourse for the living. I was never scared of trying new things, but after all I realised that busines, marketing and communications are the truly holders of my passion. During my study in the university (Demidov Yaroslavl State University) I was lucky to make a small but rather effective business. I was buying wristwatches wholesale in Moscow and organised a retail eCommerse in my town. It was those times when SMM and SEO were not such big words. At least, in Russia. I realised that internet is a great opportunity. So nowadays I invest my time and effort in the internet technologies because I believe that these tools can help creating valuable and perspective business that is not only a sourse of finance but can bring a good change to the world! Currently Im a freelancer but I also would like to join a professional team as a junior developer in some interesting project. This site will tell you about things I learned so far and projects that I made

              | I started with mark-up and styling (HTML5, CSS3 (SASS, LESS и Stylus)). I also learnt Media Queries to make web pages adaptive. Then, I continued with JavaScript (or EcmaScript 5 to be precise). I started with Vanila JS but switched to JQuery as it was much more convinient in terms of DOM manipulations. But I always try to look at the 'vanilla' version of features. In every site I made I tried to use as much 'self-made' scripts as possible so I was making sliders and pop-ups by myself to become more confident in JS development. Only in the late projects I took things like Swiper js but, anyway, added some features. Lately I decided to go full-stack and took PHP and MySQL as 'cheap' and 'reliable' tools to build MVP in short period. I have an example of MVC + FrontController Web Page in my portfolio with links to GITHUB. At the moment I also would like to give a shot to SPA development with Vue, Angular, React or other front-end frameworks. But anyway I see all these languages and frameworks as tools and don't put any of these to my top charts
